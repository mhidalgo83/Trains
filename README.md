# Trains

This project uses Firebase as a means to store data, then using jQuery to create a table dynamically using that data to display information that the user has submitted. Also, using Momentjs, I was able to determine train times and when the next train would be arriving based on the first train arrival and how much time between each stop. 

For styling, I used a simple Bootstrap layout with their form, table, and jumbotron. The next step will be to make the page responsive.
